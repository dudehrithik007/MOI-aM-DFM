Notes about the Project:

Made a working model of the working of the whole company in terms of the data flow & transformations that take place in various layers, implemented it along with SCD 2 & ABC Framework on top of that, mainly for newcomers for their understanding.

Used many new topics I learned. It is a  general model, that can be changed to any other data flow model.

Used MySQL & Python. For GUI: CustomTkinter & Tkinter. It is tutorial–based, interactive, & contains required info in the form of textboxes & on the button clicks data gets filled into the files & tables respectively in real–time, i.e., it is operational. 

While writing the project report, I invented a new efficient method for Independent Path Testing (Not available anywhere on the Internet).
